description: Working rules for the รัฐธรรมนุญจำลอง site (one 5MB website_constitution.html). Load before ANY edit to that file, and again whenever a mistake happens so the lesson gets written down. Covers the structural hazard that makes broken nesting invisible, the mandatory validation script, insertion recipes, shell/encoding traps, site conventions, the commit-and-push-every-change rule, and a running log of mistakes already made — which must be appended to whenever a new one occurs.

# รัฐธรรมนุญจำลอง — working rules

Fictional worldbuilding site: a simulated Thai constitution, 38 chapters plus a
53-tab dashboard. Invented history, PMs, parties and institutions are
**intentional**. Never "correct" them toward real-world facts.

Almost everything lives in one file: `website_constitution.html`
(~5.5 MB, ~68k lines). Assets in `images/` (107 MB), `audio/`, `js/`, `css/`.

---

## RULE 1 — Commit and push after every change

The user's explicit standing instruction. Do not batch work.

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "<what changed>" && git push
```

Rationale: one 5 MB file where a bad splice can corrupt the whole site. Every
commit is a restore point. During one session 12 separate pieces of work sat
uncommitted at once — a single bad write would have destroyed all of it.

If a splice goes wrong and the work is committed, recovery is
`git checkout -- website_constitution.html`. If it is not committed, there is
no recovery. **Commit first, then edit.**

---

## RULE 2 — Tag counts do NOT prove the structure is sound

This is the single most important fact about this file.

Damage here consistently takes the form of **balanced `<div>` counts with wrong
nesting order**. Every naive check passes. The page still renders. The bug only
shows as content appearing on tabs it does not belong to.

Real cases:

- A `</div>` closed `chakri-tab` early, leaving the whole ราชวงศ์จักรี body
  outside any `.db-tab-content`. It rendered on **every** tab. Counts were
  11886/11886 — perfectly balanced.
- Two new panels were spliced **inside** `kpptp-tab` instead of beside it.
  Counts balanced (58/58, 93/93, 86/86). Only the overlap check caught it.

The user has said the original damage came from **Antigravity**, which broke the
structure and could not fix it. Treat misnesting as the default suspicion.

### The validation script — run after EVERY structural edit

```python
import re
src = open('website_constitution.html', encoding='utf-8').read()
stack, extra, spans = [], [], {}
for m in re.finditer(r'<div\b([^>]*)>|</div>', src):
    if m.group(0) == '</div>':
        if stack:
            o = stack.pop()
            if o[1]: spans[o[1]] = (o[0], src[:m.start()].count('\n') + 1)
        else:
            extra.append(src[:m.start()].count('\n') + 1)
    else:
        a = m.group(1) or ''
        idm = re.search(r'id="([^"]+)"', a)
        stack.append((src[:m.start()].count('\n') + 1,
                      idm.group(1) if (idm and 'db-tab-content' in a) else None))
sp = sorted((v[0], v[1], k) for k, v in spans.items())
overlaps = [(sp[i+1][2], sp[i][2]) for i in range(len(sp)-1) if sp[i+1][0] < sp[i][1]]
buttons = set(re.findall(r"switchTab\('([^']+)'", src))
print(f"unclosed {len(stack)} | stray {len(extra)} | panels {len(spans)} | overlaps {overlaps}")
print(f"buttons {len(buttons)} == panels: {buttons == set(spans)}")
```

**Expected healthy output:**

```
unclosed 2 | stray 0 | panels 53 | overlaps []
buttons 53 == panels: True
```

- `unclosed 2` is correct and expected — `dashboard-card` and `preamble-section`
  are knowingly left open to EOF; the browser closes them. Do not "fix" these.
- `overlaps` must be `[]`. Any entry means a panel is nested inside another.
- Buttons and panels must match exactly, both directions.

Also verify every panel sits inside the tab container:

```python
ho = src[:src.index('<section id="history_and_pms"')].count('\n') + 1
hc = src[:src.index('</section>', src.index('id="kpptp-tab"'))].count('\n') + 1
outside = [k for k, (s, e) in spans.items() if not (ho < s and e < hc)]
```

### Do NOT use per-line depth counting

A naive line-by-line depth walk reports **false overlaps**, because the file
contains lines like:

```html
</div><div id="independent-organs-tab" class="db-tab-content">
```

One line closes and opens. Always scan in document order with a stack.

Likewise, a slice-and-count of one panel's line range can report 435/434 for the
same reason. Trust the stack walk, not the slice count.

---

## RULE 3 — Insertion recipe (this is where mistakes happen)

Three separate splices went wrong in one session. Follow this exactly.

### Find a tag's real span

```python
def span(marker):
    a = src.index(marker)
    s = src.rindex('<div', 0, a)      # ← the actual opening tag
    d = 0
    for m in re.finditer(r'<div\b[^>]*>|</div>', src[s:]):
        d += 1 if m.group(0) != '</div>' else -1
        if d == 0:
            return s, s + m.end()
```

**The trap:** `src.index('id="kpptp-tab"')` points at the *attribute*, not the
tag. Starting the walk there begins one tag late, so it closes one level early
and everything spliced at that point lands *inside* the panel. Always
`rindex('<div', 0, a)` first.

### Never grab the first `</section>`

`src.index('</section>')` finds the one closing `<section class="hero">` near
line 2083 — nowhere near the tabs. A panel spliced there ends up inside the hero
banner. Tab panels live inside **`<section id="history_and_pms">`**.

Assert containment before writing:

```python
host_o = src.index('<section id="history_and_pms"')
host_c = src.index('</section>', insertion_point)
assert host_o < insertion_point < host_c, "must land inside the tab container"
```

### Never end a replacement regex on a run of closing tags

Replacing a repeated block with `re.compile(r'<div ...>.*?</div></div>', re.S)`
does **not** stop at the end of the block. It stops at the first place two
closes happen to sit together — which, for a row of cards, is the end of the
*first card*. The rest of the row survives and each replacement leaves a
surplus `</div>`.

This happened while swapping five flag rows: two-cell rows kept their old
second cell, and the validator reported `unclosed 1 | stray 4`.

Match the block's real extent by walking depth from its opening tag, exactly as
in **Find a tag's real span** above — or, when the block is one line, replace
the whole line by index after asserting its shape:

```python
old = lines[n - 1]
assert old.count('</div>') == old.count('<div') + 1, 'unexpected shape'
lines[n - 1] = new_row
```

### Adding a new tab — both halves are required

1. **Panel** — insert as a *sibling* after the last panel closes, inside the host
   section: `<div id="NAME-tab" class="db-tab-content"> … </div>`
2. **Button** — beside a related one in the nav:
   ```html
   <button class="db-tab-btn" onclick="switchTab('NAME-tab', this)"
           style="border-color:rgba(R,G,B,0.6);color:#HEX;">EMOJI ชื่อแถบ</button>
   ```
3. Validate. Buttons and panels must both come out at the new count.

Keep button labels short — `🔴 พรรคสีแดง`, not a parenthetical list. Long labels
wrap to two lines and look wrong.

---

## RULE 4 — Shell and encoding traps

Every one of these cost a failed command in real sessions.

| Trap | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| PowerShell here-string `@'…'@` in a Bash call | `@` becomes the commit subject line | Use `git commit -F -` with a Bash heredoc |
| Bash heredoc with large Thai/emoji content | `unexpected EOF while looking for matching` | Write the script or HTML to a file with the Write tool, then run/splice it |
| Python printing Thai on Windows | `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec` | Prefix every command: `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python …` |
| `"\\v%d.js"` in a Python path | `\v` is a vertical tab → `Invalid argument` | Use raw strings or `os.path.join` |
| `grep -P` | `-P supports only unibyte and UTF-8 locales` | Use Python `re`, or `grep -oE` |
| ripgrep lookahead `(?!…)` | `look-around … is not supported` | Filter in Python instead |
| Non-greedy `.*?` across the whole file | Matches content in unrelated sections | Scope the regex to one panel's slice first |
| Downloading from Wikimedia with no User-Agent | HTTP 200 but the body is a ~2 KB HTML error page, saved happily under a `.svg`/`.png` name | Always send `curl -A "<something descriptive>"`; check the first bytes are not `<!DOCTYPE html>` |
| Counting `<svg` / `</svg>` across the whole file | Reports one unclosed tag; the extra `<svg` is a string inside minified Leaflet at line ~1361 | Only count inside markup, or ignore `<script>` regions |
| `file://` with Thai path in the browser tool | Cannot open | Validate structurally instead; browser preview is not available for this file |
| Screenshot of the preview comes back solid dark navy | The Browser pane is hidden (`tabs_context` says so); the page itself is fine | Check `tabs_context` first; while hidden, verify with `javascript_tool` (innerText, computed colour, getBoundingClientRect) instead of retrying screenshots |

**Always read a file's real bytes before assuming.** Reading
`website_constitution.html` whole fails (5 MB > 256 KB limit) — use `offset`/
`limit`, Grep, or Python.

---

## RULE 5 — Verify claims against the file, never from memory

The user checks sources. When a figure is used, be able to name the line it came
from. When asked "เอามาจากไหน", answer with line numbers.

Before writing any factual claim, grep for it. Two examples where checking
changed the answer:

- Four places said `จอมพล (กองทัพบก)`. Three were จอมพลคงฤทธิ์; **one at line
  ~40021 was จอมพลปฏิวัติ พิบูลอสงไขย — a different person.** A blind
  replace-all would have corrupted a villain's record.
- PM 4's term count was assumed to be one 8-year term. The site actually
  documents `วาระละ ๘ ปี` for the modern era only; the older constitution used
  4-year terms, making it two terms. The user had to correct this.

**Check `images/` and git history before creating any asset.** A tab having no
`<img>` does not mean no artwork exists. Before drawing or generating anything:

```bash
ls images/ | grep -i <topic>
git rev-list --all --objects | awk '{print $2}' | grep -i <topic>
```

And verify the files are what their extension claims — several are not:

```bash
head -c 40 images/<file>        # <!DOCTYPE html> means it is an error page
```

Real case: the flag tab was rewritten with seven hand-drawn SVG flags. The user
asked whether correct images already existed. They did — `flag1.svg`,
`flag4.svg` (a 65 KB white elephant) and `flag7.svg` were real artwork deleted
by commit `e28a463`, whose message claims the opposite of what it did. Of the
seven files it touched, four were Wikimedia error pages; it kept those and
deleted the three genuine ones. All `images/flag*.png` are still error pages,
referenced nowhere.

**Do not invent numbers unless told to.** When data is missing, say which fields
are missing and ask. The user will often say "คิดขึ้นมาเองได้เลย" — only then
invent, and keep invented figures internally consistent:

- seats ÷ 5 = the stated percentage (500-seat house)
- แบ่งเขต + บัญชีรายชื่อ = total seats
- raw votes ÷ popular-vote% = a turnout that grows sensibly across eras
- respect any ceiling the user sets (e.g. "must not exceed พิธา วาระ ๒" = 76.89% / 384 seats)

---

## RULE 6 — Site conventions

**Numerals.** Thai numerals (๐-๙) for years, counts, article numbers. Arabic is
tolerated inside statistics blocks where the site already mixes them.

**Duplicate function definitions.** `switchTab` and `playAudioMobile` are defined
both inline in the HTML and in `js/constitution.js`. **`js/constitution.js` loads
last (near line 66615) and wins.** Editing the inline copies does nothing. The
two `switchTab` bodies differ.

**Tab panels** are `<div id="X-tab" class="db-tab-content">`. `switchTab` hides
by that class — anything outside it can never be hidden.

**Audio + lyrics block** (reuse verbatim, swap colours):

```html
<div class="audio-box">
  <button type="button" onclick="playAudioMobile(this, 'audio/NAME.mp3')" …>
    <span style="font-size:15px;">▶️</span> กดเล่นเพลงบนมือถือ / Play Audio
  </button>
  <audio controls preload="metadata" playsinline webkit-playsinline src="audio/NAME.mp3" …>
    <source src="audio/NAME.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    เบราว์เซอร์ของคุณไม่รองรับการเล่นไฟล์เสียง
  </audio>
</div>
```
Lyrics go below in an italic box with a coloured left border.

**Person cards** (`figures-tab`, `villains-tab`) use `tri-layout` /
`tri-profile-card` / `tri-stage`. Portrait frame is 243.75 × 304.69.

**PM roster rows** (`pms-tab`) are `<tr class="pm-row" data-era="era-N">` with
exactly **7 cells**. Portrait 220 × 275.

**Party tab PM cards** carry a stat card per term: raw votes, Popular Vote %,
ส.ส. ในสภา (n/500), โพลแรก/โพลหลัง, then a 3-column grid (ส.ส. รวม / แบ่งเขต /
บัญชีรายชื่อ), plus a footer line `จัดตั้งรัฐบาลสถาปนานายกฯ คนที่ …`. The right
column carries a ฉายา badge, name, party/years line, then achievements as
bulleted items with emoji headings.

**Images.** Portraits are ratio ~0.80 (e.g. 800×1000). Crop landscape sources
centred, keep full height, save JPEG q92. Check the result with Read before
using it.

---

## RULE 7 — Cross-references must stay consistent

Facts are duplicated across tabs. Changing one means sweeping for the others.

When a new PM is added, update **all** of:
- the roster row in `pms-tab`
- the roster intro count (`ทำเนียบนายกรัฐมนตรีทั้ง ๓๓ คน`)
- the tab button label (`🏛️ ทำเนียบนายกรัฐมนตรี (๓๓ ท่าน)`)
- the previous PM's end year — two PMs cannot both be `ปัจจุบัน`
- the party card in `parties-tab` (`นายกรัฐมนตรีคนปัจจุบัน: …`)
- the democracy timeline era in `timelineData`
- the party tab card, if the party has one

Sweep afterwards:

```bash
grep -c '๒๖๙๘-ปัจจุบัน' website_constitution.html          # must be 0
grep -n 'นายกรัฐมนตรีคนปัจจุบัน' website_constitution.html  # only one Thai PM
```

**`timelineData`** (around line 2396) is an array of
`{title, desc1, desc2, desc3, result}` rendered by `selectTimelineEra(index)`.
It is index-driven with no hardcoded length, so adding entries is safe — but
each entry needs a matching `<button onclick="selectTimelineEra(N, this)">`.
Verify by executing the array with node, not by eye.

---

## RULE 8 — Record every mistake in this file, immediately

**This skill is the memory. If a mistake is not written down here, it will
happen again.** Standing instruction from the user: เรียนรู้จากความผิดพลาด.

### When something goes wrong

The moment a command fails, a splice lands in the wrong place, a fact turns out
wrong, or the user corrects something:

1. **Fix it** — and say plainly what broke and why. Never quietly re-run and
   hope. The user reads the reasoning, not just the result.
2. **Write it into this file** — into the matching rule if one fits (a shell
   failure goes in the RULE 4 table, a bad splice in RULE 3), otherwise into the
   mistake log below.
3. **Commit both together** — the fix and the skill update, in one commit, then
   push. The lesson must not outlive the session in memory alone.

### What counts as worth recording

Record it if a future session could repeat it:

- a command that failed for an environment reason (quoting, encoding, a flag)
- a wrong assumption about the file's structure or conventions
- a fact asserted without checking that turned out wrong
- a user correction — **especially** a correction, because it means the
  reasoning was wrong, not just the typing
- a near-miss caught by validation — those are the most valuable, since the
  validation is the only thing standing between a bad splice and a broken site

Do **not** record: one-off typos with no pattern, anything already covered.

### How to write an entry

State what was done, what actually happened, and the rule that prevents it.
Be concrete — line numbers, the exact wrong string, the exact right one. Vague
entries ("be careful with splices") teach nothing.

Do not soften entries to look better. An entry that hides what really happened
is worse than no entry, because it creates false confidence.

---

## Mistake log

Newest last. Entries here have all actually happened.

**Grabbed the first `</section>` in the file.** Spliced a new tab panel at
`src.index('</section>')`, which is the one closing `<section class="hero">`
near line 2083. The panel landed inside the hero banner, ~38,000 lines from the
tab container. Counts stayed balanced, so nothing looked wrong. → RULE 3:
assert the insertion point is inside `<section id="history_and_pms">`.

**Searched for an id attribute instead of the opening tag.** Used
`src.index('id="kpptp-tab"')` as the start of a div walk. That position is the
*attribute*, so the first regex match was the *next* `<div`, the depth counter
started one tag late and hit zero one level early. Two new panels were spliced
**inside** `kpptp-tab`. Div counts: 58/58, 93/93, 86/86 — all balanced. Only the
overlap check caught it. → RULE 3: always `rindex('<div', 0, a)` first.

**Used PowerShell here-string syntax in a Bash call.** `git commit -m @'…'@`
put a literal `@` on line 1, making it the commit subject. Had to amend. → RULE
4: `git commit -F -` with a Bash heredoc.

**Chained `python -c "…"` and a heredoc in one command.** Bash failed with
``unexpected EOF while looking for matching ` `` — while committing this very
skill file, which already warned about heredoc fragility. → Run validation and
commit as separate calls.

**Assumed a term length instead of checking.** Reasoned that because PM 30 is
labelled "วาระที่ ๒ และ ๓", PM 4's eight years must be one term. The user
corrected it: under รธน. ๒๔๔๕ a term was 4 years, so it is two terms. The site
states `วาระละ ๘ ปี` for the modern era only (lines 16444, 38535, 38574) — the
evidence was there and went unread. → RULE 5: grep before asserting.

**Nearly ran a replace-all across different people.** Four places contained
`จอมพล (กองทัพบก)`. Three were จอมพลคงฤทธิ์; one (~line 40021) was
**จอมพลปฏิวัติ พิบูลอสงไขย**, a different character. Checking each occurrence's
nearest `tri-profile-name` first prevented corrupting a villain's record. →
RULE 5: identify *whose* record each match belongs to before any bulk edit.

**Left twelve pieces of work uncommitted at once.** Four new tabs, four binary
assets and many edits sat unsaved while the user kept requesting more. A single
bad splice would have destroyed all of it. The user then made commit-and-push
standing policy. → RULE 1.

**Under-reported available data.** Used `๗๒.๙%` for Thaksin's 2680 election
from the roster line, without checking the fuller record at line 39207 — which
also had seat counts (๓๖๔/๕๐๐) and both poll figures (๔๑% → ๖๘.๗%). The user
asked "เอามาจากไหน" and the better source surfaced. → RULE 5: find *all*
occurrences of a fact, then use the richest one.

**Drew artwork without checking whether artwork existed.** Rebuilt the flag
tab with seven hand-made SVG flags, having only checked that the *tab* had no
`<img>`. `images/` and git history both held real files. The user had to ask
twice before the check happened. → RULE 5: search `images/` and
`git rev-list --all --objects` before creating any asset.

**Ended a replacement regex on `</div></div>`.** Swapping five flag rows, the
non-greedy match stopped at the end of the first *cell* instead of the row.
Two-cell rows kept their old second cell and each row gained a surplus close;
validator reported `unclosed 1 | stray 4`. Recovery by `git checkout` and
`git stash` were both refused by the permission classifier as irreversible, so
the fix had to go forward: rebuild the five affected lines by index. → RULE 3,
and note that reverting is not always available — prefer an edit that cannot
break in the first place.

**Trusted a commit message over the bytes.** `e28a463` says "Replace SVG flag
error files with real 320px PNG flag thumbnails from Wikipedia". It replaced
real files with error pages. Read the bytes, not the subject line.

**Derived a structure from a count instead of reading it.** Wrote that
referendum round 5 ratified "หมวด ๓๗-๓๘" because the site says ๓๘ หมวด. No
such chapters exist: the charter is หมวด ๑-๓๖ + บทเฉพาะกาล + หมวดพิเศษ
(ม.๑๑๕๒-๑๑๕๙). Then labelled the chapter map's rounds from the referendum tab's
prose ("รอบที่ ๔") when every article carries its own tag
("ประชามติรอบที่ ๔-๕"). → RULE 5: the per-article tags and the `<h>` headings
are the source of truth; extract them, don't infer them.

**Changed an emoji that appears in two tabs.** `🇪🇺 สหพันธรัฐใหม่ (TSL)`
occurs on geopolitics-tab and on world-economy-tab ("TSL / EU"); the assert
caught the second copy. Scope replacements to one panel's span.

**Invented a whole cast when the user had one.** Built the cabinet tab with 20
made-up minister names because the site named none. The user already had the
full line-up — real politicians, several holding two ministries, the PM holding
three — and replaced every name. → Before inventing *named people*, ask. Numbers
and flavour text can be invented on "คิดขึ้นมาเองได้เลย"; a roster of
characters is the user's to cast. Also: use the site's spelling of titles
(`พล.ต.อ.ทักษิณ`, 3 existing uses) over a typed variant (`พล.ตร.อ.`, 0 uses).

**Copied real-world 2475 history into canon.** The constitutions table said
ร.๗ granted the ๒๓๗๕ charter "ร่วมกับคณะราษฎร", and I copied that into a new
card. The user caught it. In this site's canon ร.๗ granted it himself, without
violence; คณะราษฎร is หลวงประดิษฐ์มนูธรรม's faction, filed under villains, and the
"๔ ทหารเสือ" refused to join it *because* the charter had already been granted
(chakri-tab). This is the same leak as Manopakorn's ๒๔๗๕ dates. → Anything
touching 2475 — คณะราษฎร, สมุดปกเหลือง, ๒๔ มิถุนายน, "ฉบับถาวร ๑๐ ธันวาคม" —
is probably real history, not canon. Check it against rama7-tab and chakri-tab
before repeating it, even when the text is already on the site.

**Read every article's badge one article late.** Each article is a card:
`<div class="article-card" id="art_N" data-origin="…">` → header with
`<span class="badge …">` → body with `มาตรา N`. The badge comes **before** the
number. Scanning forward from "มาตรา N" for the next badge returns article
N+1's. Two consequences, both real: (1) earlier in the session the user's
request to mark ม.๑๐๘ "แก้ไขจาก รธน. ๒๔๔๕" was applied to ม.๑๐๙, because the
edit was scoped "between มาตรา ๑๐๘ and มาตรา ๑๐๙" — which is ม.๑๐๙'s header;
(2) the ๒๔๔๕ tab's amended list, per-chapter bars and a "moved article" claim
were all built on shifted tags. Caught only when a tooltip forced a look at the
raw markup. → Address an article by its card: `id="art_N"`, and read its badge
between that id and `<div class="article-body">`. Never infer ownership of a
badge from proximity to the number.

## Known-good baseline

```
unclosed 2 (dashboard-card, preamble-section) | stray 0 | panels 53 | overlaps []
buttons 53 == panels: True
13 inline <script> blocks, all pass node --check
0 broken local references
